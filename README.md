# Walmart Sales Forecast

This repository contains analysis and modeling based on the [Walmart Sales Forecast](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/walmart-sales-forecast) dataset. The goal is to forecast weekly sales for each store and department using historical data enriched with promotional, economic, and seasonal features.

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset covers weekly sales data from 45 Walmart stores across the U.S., along with supporting information like store size, type, temperature, fuel prices, consumer price index, unemployment, and promotional markdowns.

It includes the following CSV files:

- **`train.csv`** — Historical sales data from 2010 to 2012.
- **`test.csv`** — Data for which weekly sales are to be predicted.
- **`stores.csv`** — Metadata for each store (type and size).
- **`features.csv`** — External features like temperature, fuel price, CPI, and promotions.

 The data spans February 2010 to November 2012 for training, and extends into 2013 for testing.
